-- cfpposter: cfp's style file for LaTeX class a0poster. --
-----------------------------------------------------------

***********************************************************
* INSTALLATION:
***********************************************************

To install just copy the folder "cfpposter" into some directory
that LaTeX knows about in your system. There are several ways,
but I suggest either of the following:

1. [Any User]
   Copy the folder cfpposter to ~/texmf/tex/latex/ (this is a path
   relative to your home directory; create the parent directories 
   as needed) and run the command "mktexlsr"
   at any terminal.

2. [Any User]
   Copy only the file "cfpposter.sty" into the same folder where you
   have a *.tex document you want to compile with this style.

3. [As root] 
   Copy the folder "cfpposter" to "/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/" and 
   then run the command "mktexlsr".

In the subfolder "Example" exists an example file "poster.tex"
that should guide you in building your own presentation.
You can compile this example by issuing inside the "Example" directory:

$ latex poster
$ bibtex poster
$ latex poster
$ latex poster
$ latex poster

... and then generate a PostScript by doing:

$ dvips -Ppdf -t a0 poster.dvi -o poster.ps

... if you want a PDF in the end:

$ ps2pdf poster.ps poster.pdf

You can generate a PDF file directly from the DVI using:

$ dvipdf poster.dvi poster.pdf

If you have a standard LaTeX installation, this example
should compile smoothly without any error!

* IMPORTANT NOTICE: 
***********************************************************

Before starting, please be aware that this style file
only works in conjunction with the LaTeX document class 
"a0poster". So, if this class is not part of your TeX
installation yet, you should install it and test it before
trying to set up "cfpposter".
